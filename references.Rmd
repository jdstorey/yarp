The following books have served as references while writing *YARP*:

- [*Advanced R*](http://adv-r.had.co.nz), by Hadley Wickham
- [*Elements of Data Analytic Style*](https://leanpub.com/datastyle), by Jeff Leek
- [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz), by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
- [*R Programming for Data Science*](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming), by Roger Peng
- [R help files](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) provided by the developers of R and contributed packages

Once you have finished reading *YARP*, I encourage you to read these more comprehensive references.
